## Description

This is my initial project for this Coding Bootcamp.  The main obective of this project was to adjust and fix an already created main webpage.  Below are the changes that I created to make the page more functional and create more widespread accessability.  The changes were made in the index.html and the style.css.
- In the index.html I created megatags to make the page accessible and searchable throughout the web.

 - I also changed several of the values for semantic reasons to create more consistent flow to the index.  Those changes included:
    
   - Changing div tags to header, nav, article, and main.
   - Changing header tags to section and aside.

- In the style.css I adjusted the div commands to nav since they were changed in the index.html.

- I added a hover decoration to hyperlinks to show they are active buttons.

- I added main to remove several redundant declaration commands and moved the main commands up to create a more consistent flow.

- I added the class "benefit"  to remove redundant declaration commands.
